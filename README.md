# Streaming Client

Sample GraphQL Streaming client for the [Oracle Hospitality Integration Platform (OHIP)](https://www.oracle.com/uk/industries/hospitality/integration-platform/) [Streaming API](https://blogs.oracle.com/hospitality/post/ohip-introduces-state-of-the-art-streaming-api-and-rich-analytics).

> `Important`: This is **NOT** an official GraphQL Subscription Client for the OHIP Streaming API. It is a **sample client** built for demo purposes. Use it at your own risk.

## Features

- Load connection/stream parameters from environment variables
- Automatic refresh of OAuth tokens every 59 minutes (including 500ms delay between disconnecting and re-connecting to avoid `4409`)
- Automatic reconnection in case of network intermittent errors or server failures
- detail logs at different levels (info, debug, silly)
- Statistics around number of messages processed per second, minute or hour as well as total number of messages received per event type
- Support for subscription parameters: chain, hotelId, offset (partial only) and delta.

## Installation

- Install node:

  To easily install multiple versions of node locally, it is recommended to first install [node version manager (nvm)](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) and then install the require version as following:

  ```bash
  NODE_VERSION=20.0.0
  nvm install $NODE_VERSION
  nvm alias default $NODE_VERSION
  nvm use default #to set this version of node as default in your environment
  nvm use #to set the node version based on the .nvmrc file
  ```

  > the above assumes you've installed nvm as described [here](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm), including [this step](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#nvmrc).

- Install the node modules used in the project:

  ```bash
  npm install typescript
  ```

  All other dependencies are installed via `npm`

  ```bash
  npm install
  ```

## Configuration

Before running the application all required environment variables.

- If testing locally, variables can be added to an `.env` file

```bash
touch .env
```

- Set environment variables as following:
  
```bash
# OHIP gateway URL from OHIP dev portal environment
APIGW_URL=
# OHIP websocket gateway URL. Normally similar to API GW but with WS protocol
WS_URL=
# Endpoints
OAUTH_ENDPOINT=/oauth/v1/tokens
SUBS_ENDPOINT=/subscriptions
# OHIP dev portal app key
APP_KEY=
# SSD integration username/password
INTEGRATION_USER=
INTEGRATION_PASSWORD=
# OHIP dev portal environment credentials
CLIENT_ID=
CLIENT_SECRET=
# OAuth token expiry timeframe. Required to refresh token before it expires and connection is interrupted
TOKEN_EXPIRY=3540000
# Frequency to ping server
PING=10000
# Time to wait between re-connecting. Recommended 10000 ms (10 seconds)
TIMER=10000
# OPERA Cloud chain for the subscription. Can be obtained from the app subscription in dev portal
CHAIN=
# (Optional) Enter a property Id to filter events generated only in that property
# HOTELID=
# (Optional) Enter value if to stream events from a given offset. Default is 0 (meaning all prior events up to 7 days all wil be streamed)
# OFFSET=0
# (Optional) Enter true to omit old and new values which are similar. Default is false
# DELTA=true
# Log level options: silly, trace, debug, info, warn, error, fatal
LOGLEVEL=debug
# Set Stats. true or false. Default is false.
STATS=true
# Stat bucket: HOUR, MINUTE (default) or SECOND. If not set time bucket won't be displayed, only summary.
TIME_BUCKET=SECOND
# Run streaming client for following time before shutting it down
RUN_FOR=7080000
# Export events to events.json file
DUMP_TO_FILE=false
# If true converts key value pairs to explicit object e.g.  "elementName": "FIRST NAME" becomes first_name
SEGMENT_CONVERSION=true
# If true converts old value and new value into array for the element
#Â e.g. first_name: ['new value','old value']. If false, creates two elements first_name and first_name_was.
STACK_VALUES=true
# If set to true, events will be pushed to Kafka. Make sure to set host, credentials, topic and client id according to your environment
KAFKA_ENABLED=false
# KAFKA_HOST=
# KAFKA_USER=
# KAFKA_PASSWORD=
# KAFKA_TOPIC=ohip-events
# KAFKA_CLIENT_ID=gs-client
```

> To use an environment file other than `.env` set the environment variable `ENVPATH` to the relative path of the env file. E.g. `export ENVPATH=./dev.env`

## Run

Once all required environment variables have been set, project can be run by executing:

```bash
npm start
```

To run in development mode, execute
